## 1. Split Dialogs into Separate Macros
- [x] Create a new macro called "DamageDialog"
  - [x] Move the dialog portion from the Damage macro to DamageDialog
  - [x] Ensure DamageDialog returns the necessary input values
- [x] Create a new macro called "WoundsDialog"
  - [x] Move the dialog portion from the Wounds macro to WoundsDialog
  - [x] Ensure WoundsDialog returns the necessary input values

## 2. Modify Existing Macros
- [x] Update the Damage macro
  - [x] Remove the dialog portion
  - [x] Add a call to DamageDialog to get input values
  - [x] Implement logic to accept parameters from Attack macro
  - [x] Implement logic to call the Wounds macro with the result
- [x] Update the Wounds macro
  - [x] Remove the dialog portion
  - [x] Add a call to WoundsDialog to get input values
  - [x] Implement wound application logic
- [x] Update the Attack macro
  - [x] Add clickable icon to call the Damage macro
  - [x] Pass critical hit and Wuchtschlag information to Damage macro

## 3. Implement Macro Chaining
- [x] In the Damage macro:
  - [x] After calculating damage, call the Wounds macro
  - [x] Pass the damage result and hit location to the Wounds macro
- [x] In the Attack macro:
  - [x] After determining a successful hit, provide option to call the Damage macro
  - [x] Pass relevant attack information to the Damage macro

## 4. Add some macros and functionality
- [x] We no longer need to say "Mit Wuchtschlag (x)" in the Attack macro behind the Erfolg line.
- [x] We should choose a different icon for the clickable Wounds icon in the Damage macro.
- [x] We should address the remaining TODOs in the Wounds macro.
  - [x] We should decrease the Initiative for the token by -2W6 if a newly applied first or second Kopfwunde is rolled. Needs a new line in the output that says how much Initiative was lost.
  - [x] We should roll additional damage if a Bauchwunde is applied, 1W6 extra for each newly applied (!) first or second Bauchwunde. Needs a new line in the output that shows how much additional damage was rolled.
  - [x] We should roll additional damage if a third Kopfwunde is applied, 2W6 extra damage. Needs a new line in the output that shows how much additional damage was rolled.

## 5. Testing
- [x] Test the Attack macro to ensure it correctly calls Damage
- [x] Test the Damage macro to ensure it correctly calls Wounds
- [x] Verify that dialog inputs are correctly passed between macros

## 6. Documentation
- [x] Update README.md with a logical overview of the macro system

## 7. Optimization
- [ ] Review the macro chain to use the proper Flags so players can use the macros
- [ ] Consider consolidating repeated code or calculations
- [ ] Wounds on Meisterpersonen should also be taken into account for AT (ald later PA) rolls

## 8. Additional Enhancements
- [ ] Implement a way to easily toggle between different weapon damages for the same character
- [ ] Add support for special abilities or effects that modify damage or wound calculations
- [x] Create a user interface for managing zone armor values
